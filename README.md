## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a relational database to efficiently manage conferences. The database is designed to handle detailed aspects of conferences such as scheduling, participant management, and resource allocation, using PostgreSQL and the PgAdmin 4 interface.

## Features
- **Database Schema Design**: Design and implementation of a relational schema that organizes and maintains information about conferences, including sessions, participants, speakers, and expenses.
- **Data Manipulation**: Implementation of SQL scripts for data insertion, updates, deletion, and complex queries to manage and retrieve data effectively.
- **Integrity Constraints**: Establishment of integrity constraints to maintain data accuracy and reliability.
- **Triggers**: Implementation of database triggers to automate processes and ensure data consistency.

## Development Process
- **Requirements Gathering**: Identification of the necessary data types and relationships to support conference management.
- **Entity-Relationship Model**: Development of an ER model to visually represent data entities and their relationships.
- **Relational Schema**: Transformation of the ER model into a relational schema optimized for PostgreSQL.
- **Database Implementation**:
  - Creation of tables with SQL scripts.
  - Definition of integrity constraints to enforce business rules.
  - Use of views to simplify data access and manipulation.

## Data Management
- **Data Insertion**: Scripts for populating the database with initial data.
- **Data Updates and Deletion**: Scripts for maintaining the database content, reflecting changes as needed.
- **Queries**: Implementation of various SQL queries to fetch data for administrative tasks and reporting.

## Conclusion
The project exemplifies the practical application of database design principles taught in the course, enhancing both theoretical knowledge and practical skills in managing complex data systems for real-world applications.
